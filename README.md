# T.O.P : Etch-a-Sketch
The Odin Project's 3rd assignment: build an etch-a-sketch canvas for browsers.

Features required by the assignment:
- 1: ability to draw in a canvas with mouse movement
- 2: ability to erase the canvas and start over
- 3: ability to choose the "resolution" of the canvas, in a pixel-like form

Optional features:
- 4: random color (originally, the assignment suggested one random color for each pixel, but I came to prefer one new random color for each new canvas)
- 5: make color darker with each pass over the same pixel

Extra features of my own volition:
- 6: input field for selecting canvas resolution (instead of a prompt, which can be annoying)
- 7: radio buttons for selecting drawing color 
- 8: canvas auto recreation when color option is changed
- 9: support for keyboard command on the resolution field (acts on 'space' and 'enter' keys)

Time to create the canvas (which varies with resolution) and the current drawing color can be accessed on the console.

(since for the scope of this assignment, there is no way to "lift the pencil from the paper", I decided it was more appropriate to call my page a *Single-Line Drawing challenge*)
